## Setup

I want everything to be done on feature branches, so the first commit is empty:

[commit-2022-02-26-08-40](https://github.com/pitnyr/elm-maker/commit/9b124ab0ddeabb1b1417aa50bd71ca6e2d5b442c)
```email
subject: Add empty root commit
```

<a id="commit-2022-02-26-09-48"></a>

The remaining setup is handled in feature branch [setup](setup.md).

[commit-2022-02-26-09-48](https://github.com/pitnyr/elm-maker/commit/2663e5177d5d49a4e22419d2dc8e5be4c6c87f23)
```email
subject: Merge branch 'setup'

Setup the project structure.
```
